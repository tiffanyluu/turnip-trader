    content:
      "There are three main turnip patterns in Animal Crossing: Spike, Decreasing, and Random. Spike patterns have one major price increase during the week, usually mid-week. Decreasing patterns steadily drop from Monday to Saturday. Random patterns fluctuate unpredictably throughout the week.",

    title: "When to Sell - Timing Your Sales",
    content:
      "Monitor your prices daily. If you see prices above 150 bells and you bought for 90-110, that's usually a good profit. Don't wait too long on Thursday/Friday as prices often crash. Saturday is your last chance, so sell even at a loss rather than lose everything.",

  {
    title: "Spike Pattern Recognition",
    content:
      "Spikes typically happen Tuesday through Thursday. Look for a sudden jump from low prices (60-80 bells) to high prices (200-400 bells). If you see this pattern emerging, sell immediately during the spike as it won't last long.",
  },
  {
    title: "Decreasing Pattern Strategy",
    content:
      "If Monday and Tuesday prices keep dropping, you're likely in a decreasing pattern. Cut your losses early - sell by Wednesday if possible. Waiting longer will only make losses worse. Better to lose 20-30% than 60-80%.",
  },
  {
    title: "Random Pattern Strategy",
    content:
      "Random patterns can surprise you with good prices any day. Monitor prices carefully and sell when you see a good opportunity above 120-130 bells. Don't wait too long as random patterns can drop unexpectedly.",

    title: "Risk Management for Turnip Trading",
    content:
      "Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify by visiting friends' islands for better prices. Keep track of your patterns week to week. If you've had decreasing patterns recently, you're more likely to get a spike pattern next week.",

  {
    title: "Using Online Tools and Communities",
    content:
      "Join turnip trading communities to find islands with good prices. Use prediction tools to forecast your week's pattern. Share your prices to help others. Remember that patterns can change, so always have a backup plan.",

    title: "Common Mistakes to Avoid",
    content:
      "Don't hold turnips past Saturday - they rot Sunday morning. Don't panic sell on Monday unless prices are really good. Don't ignore daily price checks. Don't travel backwards in time as it will rot your turnips instantly.",
