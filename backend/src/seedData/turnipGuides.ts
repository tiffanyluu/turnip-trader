    title: "Understanding Turnip Patterns - The Basics",
    content:
      "There are four main turnip patterns in Animal Crossing: Large Spike, Small Spike, Decreasing, and Random. Large spike patterns have one massive price increase (200-600% of buy price) during the week, usually Tuesday-Thursday. Small spike patterns have a moderate increase (140-200%). Decreasing patterns steadily drop from Monday to Saturday. Random patterns fluctuate unpredictably with small peaks.",

    title: "When to Sell - Timing Your Sales",
    content:
      "Monitor your prices daily. If you see prices above 150 bells and you bought for 90-110, that's usually a good profit. Don't wait too long on Thursday/Friday as prices often crash. Saturday is your last chance, so sell even at a loss rather than lose everything.",
  },
  {
    title: "Large Spike Pattern Recognition",
    content:
      "Large spikes typically happen Tuesday through Thursday. Look for a sudden jump from low prices (60-80 bells) to very high prices (300-600 bells). This is the most profitable pattern - sell immediately during the spike as it only lasts one price period and won't repeat.",
  },
  {
    title: "Small Spike Pattern Strategy",
    content:
      "Small spikes reach 140-200% of your buy price and are more predictable than large spikes. They usually occur mid-week after an initial price drop. While not as profitable as large spikes, they're still good opportunities - sell during the peak.",
  },
  {
    title: "Decreasing Pattern Strategy",
    content:
      "If Monday and Tuesday prices keep dropping, you're likely in a decreasing pattern. Cut your losses early - sell by Wednesday if possible. Waiting longer will only make losses worse. Better to lose 20-30% than 60-80%.",
  },
  {
    title: "Random Pattern Strategy",
    content:
      "Random patterns can surprise you with good prices any day, but peaks rarely exceed 140% of buy price. Monitor prices carefully and sell when you see a good opportunity above 120-130 bells. Don't wait too long as random patterns can drop unexpectedly.",

    title: "Risk Management for Turnip Trading",
    content:
      "Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify by visiting friends' islands for better prices. Keep track of your patterns week to week. If you've had decreasing patterns recently, you're more likely to get a spike pattern next week.",

    title: "Using Online Tools and Communities",
    content:
      "Join turnip trading communities to find islands with good prices. Use prediction tools to forecast your week's pattern. Share your prices to help others. Remember that patterns can change, so always have a backup plan.",

    title: "Common Mistakes to Avoid",

      "Don't hold turnips past Saturday - they rot Sunday morning. Don't panic sell on Monday unless prices are really good. Don't ignore daily price checks. Don't travel backwards in time as it will rot your turnips instantly.",
